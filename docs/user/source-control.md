# Source Control Integrations

Atlas connects to your Git hosting provider so you can create pull requests, review code, and manage repositories without leaving the app.

## Supported Providers

Atlas works with the platforms your team already uses:

- **GitHub** – Pull requests, repository creation, and clone integration
- **GitLab** – Merge requests, repository publishing, and hosted clones
- **Bitbucket** – Pull request workflows (via API token authentication)
- **Azure DevOps** – Pull request support for Microsoft-hosted repositories

## What You Can Do

### Start Projects from Anywhere

**Clone repositories directly**

- Open the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) → **Add Project**
- Choose **GitHub repository**, **GitLab repository**, **Bitbucket repository**, **Azure DevOps repository**, or paste any **Git URL**
- Enter the repository path (`owner/repo`, `group/project`, `workspace/repository`, or `project/repository`) or a full Git URL, pick a destination, and start coding

**Publish local projects to the cloud**

- Have a local Git repository without a remote?
- Use the **Publish Repository** action to create a new hosted repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps), add it as your origin remote, and push, in one flow
- If the local repository has no commits yet, publishing creates the remote and wires it up but does not push. Make a commit, then push normally.

### Manage Code Reviews Without Context Switching

**Create pull requests while you work**

- Push a branch and create a pull request from the Git actions controls in the toolbar
- Atlas can suggest titles and descriptions based on your commits
- Supports GitHub Pull Requests, GitLab Merge Requests, Bitbucket Pull Requests, and Azure DevOps Pull Requests

**Stay on top of open reviews**

- See if your current branch already has an open PR/MR
- Open the review directly in your browser with one click
- Command-click (Control-click on Windows and Linux) a pull request number in the sidebar to open it in your browser instead of in T3 Code
- Check out a teammate's branch to review code locally

### Let a Chat Ship Its Own Work

Some threads produce work you do not want to review — a chore, a rename, a
dependency bump. Turn on **Auto-ship** in that chat's composer controls (next to
**Generate stories**; under the **…** menu on narrow windows) and Atlas takes the
whole trip itself: at the end of every turn that changed the codebase it commits,
pushes, opens a pull request, and squash-merges it. Nobody is asked to look at it
in between.

- It is per chat, and it stays on until you turn it off. The button shows its
  state, and the tooltip says what it will do.
- Turning it on ships whatever is already in the worktree, so you see straight
  away that it works.
- Turns that change nothing ship nothing — asking a question does not open a
  pull request.
- It needs a worktree. A chat working the project directory directly has no
  branch of its own, so the toggle is disabled and says so.
- Every ship writes a line into the chat's timeline. If the merge is refused —
  a required check, a conflict, a branch-protection rule — the pull request is
  still open and the line links to it so you can finish it by hand.
- Auto-ship does not delete the branch it merged: the chat is still working in
  it.
- Once the merge lands, the chat settles itself — it drops out of the active
  list without being archived, and your next message brings it back.

### Know Your Setup at a Glance

The **Source Control settings** page shows you exactly what's connected:

- ✅ Which providers are authenticated and ready
- ⚠️ What's missing and how to fix it
- 👤 Which account is signed in (when available)

Run a quick **Rescan** after setting up a new machine or changing credentials.

## Getting Started

### For GitHub (Recommended for most users)

1. Install the GitHub CLI on the machine running Atlas:
   ```bash
   brew install gh
   ```
2. Sign in:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
3. Open **Settings → Source Control** in Atlas and verify GitHub shows as authenticated

You can now clone, publish, and create pull requests.

### For GitLab

1. Install the GitLab CLI:
   ```bash
   brew install glab
   ```
2. Authenticate:
   ```bash
   glab auth login
   ```
3. Check **Settings → Source Control** to confirm the connection

### For Bitbucket

Bitbucket uses tokens instead of a CLI tool. Two options, both set as environment variables on the
machine running Atlas.

Recommended, a Bitbucket access token:

```bash
export T3CODE_BITBUCKET_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-access-token"
```

Or an Atlassian account email plus API token, with read/write access to pull requests and
repositories:

```bash
export T3CODE_BITBUCKET_EMAIL="you@example.com"
export T3CODE_BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN="your-token"
```

If both are set, the access token wins. Restart Atlas and verify the connection in **Source
Control settings**.

### For Azure DevOps

1. Install Azure CLI:
   ```bash
   brew install azure-cli
   ```
2. Add the DevOps extension:
   ```bash
   az extension add --name azure-devops
   ```
3. Sign in:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

## Requirements & Troubleshooting

**Git is required** – Atlas uses Git for all local operations. Ensure `git` is installed on your server.

**Server-side setup** – Authentication happens on the machine running Atlas (the server), not your local browser. If you're using a hosted or team instance, your administrator may have already configured providers.

**Common issues:**

- **Provider shows "Not authenticated"** – Run the login command for that provider (e.g., `gh auth login`) in a terminal on the server, then rescan in Settings
- **Bitbucket not connecting** – Double-check your environment variables are set in the correct shell profile and the server was restarted
- **Can't push to a remote** – Verify your Git remote URL matches the provider you've authenticated with (SSH vs HTTPS remotes may need different credentials)

**Need more help?** Check your provider's CLI documentation:

- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
- [GitLab CLI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/)
